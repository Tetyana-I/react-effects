## Part 1 - Deck of Cards
*Deck of Card* app displays a deck of cards, one card at a time. When the page loads, it goes to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card.

Every button click, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck. If you try to draw when there are no cards remaining, an alert message appears on the screen with the text “Error: no cards remaining!”.
